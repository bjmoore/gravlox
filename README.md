## Gravlox

An implementation of the Lox language and bytecode VM described in https://craftinginterpreters.com/.

Intended to be a fairly literal translation of the C structure to native Rust. This leads to a few ungainly structures and definitely some inefficiency. If I'm still interested after working through the book I might profile and try optimizing :).
